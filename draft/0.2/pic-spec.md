# Provenance Identity Continuity (PIC) Model Specification

**Version:** 0.2 (Draft)  
**Status**: Draft – Not a Standard  
**Date:** 2026-07-15

## Abstract

This document is the **PIC Specification**: the entry point of the PIC
specification set. It defines the normative semantics of the
**Provenance Identity Continuity (PIC) Model** and indexes the subordinate
specifications that cover specific domains.

The PIC Specification expresses the execution invariants of the PIC Model in
normative form, without redefining, extending, or altering the underlying
theoretical model. In case of conflict, the **PIC Model** publications remain
authoritative for the theoretical framework, while this **PIC Specification**
is authoritative for normative requirements and conformance language.

## 1. Introduction

- The **PIC Model** defines the foundational execution theory and invariants
  (see [References](#references)).
- The **PIC Specification** (this document and its subordinate specifications)
  defines the normative semantics of the PIC Model.

Documents and implementations claiming conformance with PIC **MUST** faithfully
preserve the invariants defined by the PIC Model as expressed by this
Specification. Anything that violates these invariants is **not PIC-compliant**,
regardless of naming or intent.

Subordinate specifications:

- MUST NOT redefine, extend, or alter the invariants of the PIC Model,
- MUST incorporate the [PIC Legal Appendices](./pic-legal.md) by reference,
- are canonical only in the version designated by the Specification Steward.

| Document | Description | Status | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [PIC Prover and Verifier Specification](./pic-prover-verifier-spec.md) | Normative requirements for PIC Provers and Verifiers: the components that construct and validate Proofs of Continuity and enforce PIC invariants. | Draft 0.2 | 2026-07-15 |
| [PIC Revocation Specification](./pic-revocation-spec.md) | Revocation coordinates (`lineageId`, `grantId`, `lineageCounter`, `originIssuer`, and `branchId` in branch-capable profiles) and their hop-by-hop continuity, the requirements for turning a historical selector into a causal cutoff, and revocation-authorization and revocation-state requirements. | Draft 0.2 | 2026-07-18 |
| [PIC Lineage Guardrail Specification](./pic-lineage-guardrail-spec.md) | Lineage guardrails: declarative, monotonic bounds on what an execution lineage is permitted to do, checked at each hop alongside continuity — complementing attenuation (which narrows authority) and revocation (which withdraws it). | Draft 0.2 | 2026-07-19 |

## 3. Legal Notices

The appendices governing:

- **A.** Use of Automated Language Assistance,
- **B.** Authorship, Stewardship, Attribution, and Derivative Works,
- **C.** Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability,
- **D.** Acknowledgements,

are maintained in a single canonical document, the
**[PIC Legal Appendices](./pic-legal.md)** (`draft/0.2/pic-legal.md`), and are
**incorporated into this specification by reference** as if fully set forth
herein.

In case of conflict between this document and the PIC Legal Appendices, the
PIC Legal Appendices prevail for legal, governance, licensing, and attribution
matters.
