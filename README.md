# PIC Official Repository

This repository hosts the **official materials for the Provenance Identity Continuity (PIC) framework**, including:

- the **PIC Model** (conceptual and formal foundations),
- the **PIC Spec** (normative specification of execution semantics and invariants),
- and, when published, **PIC Protocol specifications** defining concrete protocol
  encodings and interoperability profiles.

Together, these documents define what it means for a system to be
**PIC-compliant**.

> “This work is based on the Provenance Identity Continuity (PIC) Model created by  
> Nicola Gallo. The model and its initial specification originate from this work.  
> Maintenance of the PIC Spec and related PIC Protocol documents is performed over  
> time by the PIC Spec Contributors, with authorship of the model remaining with  
> Nicola Gallo.”

## Scope and Authority

- This repository contains the **Official PIC Spec** and related official
  specifications.
- PIC Protocol documents, when present, **implement** the PIC Model as defined
  by the PIC Spec and do not redefine its core invariants.
- Forks and derivative works may exist under the terms of the license, but **must
  not represent themselves as canonical** unless explicitly designated.
