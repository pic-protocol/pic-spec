# PIC Official Repository

This repository hosts the **official materials for the Provenance Identity Continuity (PIC) framework**, including:

- the **PIC Model** — the conceptual and formal theoretical framework,
- the **PIC Specification (PIC Spec)** — the normative definition of execution semantics and invariants,
- and, when published, **PIC Protocol specifications** defining concrete protocol encodings and interoperability profiles.

Together, these documents define what it means for a system to be
**PIC-compliant**.

>  
> The **PIC Specification** and all related official documents are published,
> maintained, and governed by **Nitro Agility S.r.l.** as the Specification Steward.

## Scope and Authority

- This repository contains the **Official PIC Specification** and related official
  documents designated by the Specification Steward.
- PIC Protocol documents, when present, **implement** the PIC Model as defined by
  the PIC Spec and MUST NOT redefine its core invariants.
- Forks and derivative works may exist under the terms of the license, but **MUST
  NOT present themselves as canonical** unless explicitly designated by the
  Specification Steward.
